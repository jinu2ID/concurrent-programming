Implementing Dekker's Algorithm

Files:
p1.c - creates two threads which increment a shared global counter
p2.c - first implementation of Dekker's algorithm to p1
p3.c - second implementation of Dekker's algorithm to p1

SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of these programs is to show Dekker's algorithm. p1.c creates a
race condition. p2.c implements Dekkers algorithm to solve this problem. p2
worked fine on my linux machine at home but not on tux. After debugging I
still do not understand why. I wrote p3.c in case I missed something in p2.
p3 worked on both machines but is not a direct implementation of Dekker's
alogrithm.

HOW TO RUN
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commands:
make - compile and run all three programs
make p1 - compile and run p1.c
make p2 - compile and run p2.c
make p3 - compile and run p3.c
make clean - remove output files
