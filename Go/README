SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------

circuitSim.go simulates digital logic using Go routines and 
channels

---------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO RUN
---------------------------------------------------------------
To run the circuit simulator use the following command:

	go run circuitSim.go [circuit file] [number of outputs]

The circuit file should follow the guidelines below. The number
of outputs should be the total outputs the circuit has not 
including the carryout (a 4-bit adder would have 4 outputs, an 
8-bit adder would have 8).

---------------------------------------------------------------

Circuit File Format
---------------------------------------------------------------

Each line of the circuit file can be one of the following:

	1 or 0
	AndGate,[input],[input],
	OrGate,[input],[input],
	NandGate,[input],[input],
	NorGate,[input],[input],
	XorGate,[input],[input],
	CarryIn,[input]
	CarryOut,[input],
	Output,[input],

A line should refer to another line for its input. A line can
be referred to by its line number(zero-based). The file should
be started with atleast a 0 or 1 as the initial input. Multiple
inputs can be added.
Lines may only refer to previous lines for input. Each line 
should be terminated with a comma. 
Please refer to the halfAdder, fullAdder, 4bitAdder, and
8bitAdder for examples.
